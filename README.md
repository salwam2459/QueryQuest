# QueryQuest - Search & Info.
# QueryQuest is a simple yet powerful search engine that indexes and searches web pages based on a set of keywords. The program takes a file containing URLs and associated content, processes the text by cleaning and tokenizing it, and builds an index to efficiently map each term to the pages where it appears. Users can input search queries with specific operators (such as + and -) to refine their search results, allowing for complex searches that include or exclude certain terms. With a clean and user-friendly interface, QueryQuest provides an accessible way to explore and retrieve relevant web pages based on keyword searches, making it a practical tool for web scraping and search functionalities.
